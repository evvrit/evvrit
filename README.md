<h1>Hi, I'm Elyse</h1>
<h3>A backend developer at Metrio Nasdaq</h3>
<h2>My story</h2>
<p>After neither an entrepreneurial career nor an acting career got off the ground, I came to software in search of logic, rules, and finity. I was enlivened to peel back the layers of abstraction and unearth the principles behind devices I had used every day for most of my life. Even more surprising to me was that on the other side of learning the fundamentals of software development, there was considerable room for creative decision-making. To me, development is equal parts science and art - I no longer have to decide between the two.</p>
<h2>My strengths</h2>
<ul>
<li>People tell me I'm a good communicator, I have a positive attitude, and I add a certain <em>je ne sais quoi</em> to a team dynamic.</li>
<li>I believe I owe a great deal of credit to the advice I received very early on: Just Build Stuff. I like learning theory as much as the next guy, but the most powerful approach I've grown to embrace is to roll up my sleeves and get to work. This is my greatest asset when it comes to technical skill.</li>
<li>Although these days more of my attention is focused on DB architecture, I have a keen eye for design and good instincts when it comes to user experience. This helps me collaborate with product owners and UX designers as well as make informed software design decisions.</li>
<li>I make a pretty decent presentation. I have limited experience in the context of software, but I have reason to believe my theatre kid background will come in handy as I gain confidence in my software design decisions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>My weaknesses</h2>
<p><em>You didn't think I'd leave this out, did you? Everything has tradeoffs!!!</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Task switching is not my favourite. I do better when I have 1-2 things to deeply focus on, one at a time. I work with this limitation by organizing my work hours to suit my brain, pausing notifications for 30 minutes here and there, and saying 'no' (or rather, 'not right now') sometimes.</li>
<li>My french is not excellent. I understand it very well and can be understood, but I tend to recognize my grammatical errors 10 minutes after-the-fact (not exactly timely). I try not to beat myself up about it and I take every opportunity to practice, inside and outside of the workplace.</li>
</ul>
